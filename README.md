# Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in MATLAB.

## How to Run

1. Open MATLAB or MATLAB Online.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the MATLAB editor.
3. Run the code.

## Description

The code initializes a random grid of cells and simulates the evolution of the cells according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life. The simulation is visualized using the `imagesc` function in MATLAB, and each frame is displayed for a duration of 0.1 seconds using `pause` and `drawnow` functions.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have MATLAB installed on your machine or have access to MATLAB Online.
